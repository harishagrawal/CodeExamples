   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Valid key deletion
Details:
    TestName: TestValidKeyDeletion.
    Description: Testing the Remove function by providing a valid key present in the HashMap. This test checks if the method successfully deletes the key and returns "True".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a HashMap and insert a valid key-value pair.
    Act: Call the Remove method with the inserted key.
    Assert: The Remove method should return a "True" boolean value.
  Validation:
    This validates the method’s ability to delete an existing key from the HashMap and confirms its successful deletion by returning "True". 
  
Scenario 2: Invalid key deletion
Details:
    TestName: TestInvalidKeyDeletion.
    Description: Testing the Remove function by providing an invalid key which is not present in the HashMap. This test checks if the method returns "False" in such case.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a HashMap and insert a valid key-value pair.
    Act: Call the Remove method with a key not present in the HashMap.
    Assert: The Remove method should return a "False" boolean value.
  Validation:
    This validates the method's ability to handle an invalid key which is not present in the HashMap, thus returning False and indicating that the key was not found in the HashMap.

Scenario 3: Removing an item from an Empty HashMap
Details:
    TestName: TestRemovingFromEmptyHashMap.
    Description: Testing the Remove function by providing a key while the HashMap is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an Empty HashMap.
    Act: Call the Remove method with any key.
    Assert: The Remove method should return a "False" boolean value.
  Validation:
    This validates the method’s ability to handle an edge case where the method is executed over an empty HashMap, thus returning False and symbolizing that no deletion operation was performed.

Scenario 4: Removing an item after capacity enlargement
Details:
    TestName: TestRemovingAfterResize.
    Description: Testing the Remove function by providing a key after resizing the HashMap.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a HashMap with a small capacity and insert items to trigger resizing.
    Act: Call the Remove method with a key existing in the HashMap.
    Assert: The Remove method should return a "True" boolean value.
  Validation:
    This verifies the Remove operation's functionality after a resize operation. It confirms that keys are correctly kept during a resize and can be removed.

Scenario 5: Continuing to Remove Keys Until HashMap is Empty
Details:
    TestName: TestContinualRemovalUntillEmpty.
    Description: Testing the Remove function in a loop until the HashMap is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a HashMap and populate it with some key-value pairs.
    Act: Call the Remove method continuously for all keys in the HashMap.
    Assert: Each Remove operation should return "True", the HashMap should be empty after the last removal.
  Validation:
    This scenario ensures that the Remove method can be called in succession without any issues and that a HashMap can be thoroughly emptied by continuously calling the Remove function.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: DoS via Large Input
Issue: Classes like HashMap64 are vulnerable to DoS attacks if an attacker can control the size of the input array. This is because the memory allocation, and subsequent operations, are directly proportional to the input size. Resizing operation is dependent on the 'Count * 2' which can cause high memory consumption if not controlled properly.
Solution: To mitigate this, apply a size limit to the input array, and handle exceptions related to OutOfMemoryException with appropriate user messages. Additionally, you should conduct proper input validation and sanitation.

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Recursion
Issue: Methods 'Insert', 'InsertOrUpdate', and 'HandleCollisions' have potential for uncontrolled recursion due to unchecked nested while loops. This can lead to a system crash if an attacker can manipulate input to keep the program in an infinite recursive state.
Solution: Recursion strategies need proper base condition check to prevent uncontrolled recursion. Combine these strategies with size checks, timeouts, or termination condition to limit recursion.
