   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Valid ProvideCapacity Test

Details:
    TestName: Should_ResizeWhenTempIdCountIsGreaterThanLimitCapacity.
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality that when the ProvideCapacity method is called and the provided tempIdCount is greater than the current limitCapacity, it actually resizes the HashMap.

Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of HashMap64. Check the current limitCapacity.
    Act: Call the method ProvideCapacity with a tempIdCount greater than the acquired limitCapacity.
    Assert: Check if the limitCapacity is now equal to the tempIdCount.

Validation:
    The assertion will verify if the limit capacity of the HashMap is correctly resized when the provided tempIdCount is greater than the initial limit capacity.
    This test is necessary to ensure that the dynamic resizing functionality of the HashMap64 data structure is correctly implemented.
   
Scenario 2: Resize Not Required

Details:
    TestName: Should_NotResizeWhenTempIdCountIsNotGreaterThanLimitCapacity.
    Description: This test is meant to check that the HashMap does not resize when the tempIdCount is less than the current limitCapacity.

Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of HashMap64. Check the current limitCapacity.
    Act: Call the method ProvideCapacity with a tempIdCount less than the acquired limitCapacity.
    Assert: Check if the limitCapacity is still equal to the initial limitCapacity.

Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the HashMap correctly resists resizing when the provided tempIdCount is not greater than the initial limit capacity.
    This test is important to validate the conservative resizing policy of the HashMap64 data structure to prevent unnecessary memory consumption.

Scenario 3: Resize On Equal TempIdCount

Details:
    TestName: Should_ResizeWhenTempIdCountIsEqualToLimitCapacity.
    Description: This test checks if the HashMap resizes when the tempIdCount is equal to the current limitCapacity.

Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of HashMap64. Check the current limitCapacity.
    Act: Call the method ProvideCapacity with a tempIdCount equal to the acquired limitCapacity.
    Assert: Check if the limitCapacity is now equal to the tempIdCount.

Validation:
    The assertion will verify if the HashMap correctly resizes even when the provided tempIdCount is equal to the initial limit Capacity.
    This test ensures that the data structure has correct logic to accomodate capacity provision equal to the current capacity.

Scenario 4: Negative TempIdCount Test

Details:
    TestName: Should_ThrowExceptionWhenTempIdCountIsNegative.
    Description: This test is meant to check whether the ProvideCapacity method can handle negative values of tempIdCount. Since a negative capacity is not logical for a data structure, it should handle this by throwing an exception.

Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of HashMap64.
    Act: Call the method ProvideCapacity with a negative tempIdCount.
    Assert: Check if an exception is thrown.

Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify if the HashMap correctly throws an exception when encountering a negative value for tempIdCount.
    This test is vital to ensure error handling in the HashMap64 data structure and prevent unexpected behavior.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: None
Issue: No security vulnerabilities found in the code. It correctly resizes the data structure to avoid DOS attacks through hash collisions.
Solution: No action required.
