   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test ContainsKey() when the key was added to the HashMap.
  
Details:
  TestName: ContainsKeyReturnsTrueWhenKeyExists
  Description: This test will check if ContainsKey() method correctly acknowledges existence of a key that was added to the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: A HashMap is created and a key-value pair is added.
  Act: Invoke ContainsKey() method for the existing key.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check ContainsKey() has returned true.
Validation:
  We expect ContainsKey() to correctly identify existing keys. If it doesn't, it could lead to misleading results when using HashMap.

Scenario 2: Test ContainsKey() when key was not added to the HashMap.
  
Details:
  TestName: ContainsKeyReturnsFalseWhenKeyNotExists
  Description: This test will check if ContainsKey() method correctly acknowledges that a key does not exist in the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: A HashMap is created without any key-value pairs or with different key-value pairs.
  Act: Invoke ContainsKey() method for a non-existing key.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check ContainsKey() has returned false.
Validation:
  We expect ContainsKey() to correctly identify non-existing keys. If it returns true for a non-existing key, it could lead to incorrectly handling HashMap data.

Scenario 3: Test ContainsKey() when identical keys were added to the HashMap.
  
Details:
  TestName: ContainsKeyReturnsTrueForIdenticalKey
  Description: This test will check if ContainsKey() method correctly acknowledges presence of identical keys in the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: A HashMap is created with identical key-value pairs.
  Act: Invoke ContainsKey() method for the identical key.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check ContainsKey() has returned true.
Validation:
  The HashMap should be able to handle identical keys since it's a common scenario in real-world applications.

Scenario 4: Test ContainsKey() with multiple keys added to the HashMap.
  
Details:
  TestName: ContainsKeyReturnsCorrectValueForMultipleKeys
  Description: This test will check if ContainsKey() method correctly acknowledges presence or absence of keys in case of multiple entries in the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: A HashMap is created with multiple different key-value pairs.
  Act: Invoke ContainsKey() method for existing and non-existing keys.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check ContainsKey() has returned correct values.
Validation:
  In a typical application, a HashMap would contain multiple entries. So, it's critical to ensure ContainsKey() functions correctly in such scenarios.

Scenario 5: Test ContainsKey() method when the HashMap is empty.
  
Details:
  TestName: ContainsKeyReturnsFalseForEmptyHashMap
  Description: This test will check if ContainsKey() method correctly handles an empty HashMap. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty HashMap is created.
  Act: Invoke ContainsKey() method for any key.
  Assert: Use NUnit assertions to check ContainsKey() has returned false.
Validation:
  Finding key in an empty HashMap should always return false indicating that the hashmap did not contain any keys.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of insufficiently random values
Issue: The `GetBucket` method in the HashMap implementation uses a hashing mechanism for keys which might be predictable, leading to potential denial of service attack by an attacker being capable of providing collisions in the hash function.
Solution: Leverage a cryptographically strong random number generator for hashing or use a library method to ensure a stronger mix of keys. Understand that mitigation might affect performance.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
Issue: The `Resize` method increases the size of `buckets` array. By passing a large amount of data into the HashMap, it might allow an attacker to cause a program crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Limit the size of user input data and validate it before processing. Ensure your environment has enough resources to handle the maximum input size. Also, handle exceptions-efficiently to gracefully manage any resource allocation failures.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: There is no checks for Null values in all methods (Add, Remove, ContainsKey, etc.), which might cause potential `NullReferenceException` errors.
Solution: Add appropriate null checks, where necessary, to ensure that the program does not attempt to access memory locations that has not been assigned a value.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The `Clear` method tries to set the value and key to default, but does not ensure the resources are released back to the system.
Solution: Make sure that all the resources are properly released once they are not being used, using `Dispose` or `Finalize` methods when applicable.
