   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Testing clear method with populated HashMap

  Details:
    TestName: TestClearMethodWithPopulatedHashMap
    Description: The test checks if the "Clear" method clears the HashMap when it is populated with key-value pairs.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the HashMap and add a few key-value pairs to it.
    Act: Invoke the "Clear" method.
    Assert: Validate bucket contents and check if all the values have correctly reset to their defaults.

  Validation:
    All the key-value pairs are expected to be cleared from the HashMap. This involves the reset of all keys to 0, values to default, 'NonEmpty' field to false, 'collisionEndIndex' to 0, 'emptySlot' to -1, and 'count' to 0. The test checks for these changes and signifies the functionality of the clear ability of the HashMap to avoid unnecessary data retention when not needed.

Scenario 2: Testing clear method with an empty HashMap

  Details:
    TestName: TestClearMethodWithEmptyHashMap
    Description: The test checks if the "Clear" method behaves as expected when it is invoked on an empty HashMap.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an empty HashMap.
    Act: Invoke the "Clear" method.
    Assert: Validate bucket contents and check if all the values remain at their default values indicating no change.

  Validation:
    Since the HashMap was initially empty, invoking the "Clear" method should not result in any change. All key-value pairs should remain cleared with keys as 0, values as default, 'NonEmpty' field as false, and 'count' as 0. The main aim is to validate that the clear method does not have any adverse effects when invoked on an already empty HashMap.

Scenario 3: Testing clear method with filled and cleared HashMap

  Details:
    TestName: TestClearMethodWithFilledAndClearedHashMap
    Description: The test checks if the "Clear" method clears the HashMap correctly when executed on a previously filled and cleared HashMap.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the HashMap, add a few key-value pairs and call the 'Clear' method before the test.
    Act: Populate the HashMap again with key-value pairs, then, call the "Clear" method.
    Assert: Validate bucket contents and check if all the values are correctly reset to their defaults ensuring the HashMap is cleared.

  Validation:
    Even if the "Clear" method has been called before, invoking it again after re-populating the HashMap should correctly clear all the key-value pairs. Ensuring all fields are reset to their default values is crucial in checking the effective functioning of the 'Clear' method, irrespective of previous calls.


================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: In the 'GetBucket' method, the modulo operation is used to determine the index for a key, which is a common but problematic practice. It may result in a non-uniform distribution for larger key sets, leading to potential performance problems due to an increased number of collisions.
Solution: Consider implementing a more secure method of generating random values, such as a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The 'Remove' and 'InsertOrUpdate' methods do not check if the value for a given key is null before updating or removing it. If a null reference is passed in, it can cause unintended behavior.
Solution: Before updating or removing a value, add a null-check for the passed key.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
Issue: In the 'HandleCollisions' method, an automatic array resizing operation is performed whenever a collision is found, which can lead to resource exhaustion, particularly in cases where a large amount of collisions are expected.
Solution: Implement a resizing strategy that better handles large collision events without unnecessarily allocating memory, such as incremental resizing or load balancing.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation
Issue: The 'ProvideCapacity' and 'Resize' methods allow for potentially uncontrolled memory allocation which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Solution: Add a maximum size limit to the 'ProvideCapacity' and 'Resize' methods to mitigate the risk of excessive memory usage.
