   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Checking with Non Zero Integer Variables 
Details:
    TestName: TestNonZeroIntegerVariables.
    Description: This test checks the CalculateCapacity method with non zero integer values (positive or negative) to ensure it functions as expected.
Execution:
    Arrange: The initCapacity and loadFactor variables will be initialized with non zero numbers.
    Act: Invoke CalculateCapacity method with these parameters.
    Assert: Use NUnit assertions to ensure the method's output is as expected.
Validation:
    This test aims to confirm that the method functions correctly when provided non zero numbers as parameters. The significance of this test lies in verifying that the basic functionality of the method works as expected.

Scenario 2: Checking with Zero Input 
Details:
    TestName: TestZeroInput.
    Description: This test verifies the CalculateCapacity method's behaviour when zero is passed as the parameters.
Execution:
    Arrange: The initCapacity and loadFactor variables will be initialized as zero.
    Act: Invoke CalculateCapacity method with these parameters.
    Assert: Use NUnit assertions to ensure the method's output is as expected.
Validation:
    This test checks whether the method can appropriately calculate capacity when given zero as input.

Scenario 3: Checking with Maximum value of Int32
Details: 
    TestName: TestMaxValue.
    Description: Checking how the method reacts with large integer values (specifically, Int32's maximum value).
Execution: 
    Arrange: Initialize the initCapacity with Int32.MaxValue, and loadFactor can be assigned a random floating-point value.
    Act: Invoke CalculateCapacity method with these parameters.
    Assert: Use NUnit assertions to compare the actual outcome with the expected outcome.
Validation:
    Running this test will confirm the function's ability to handle extreme values and ensure the function doesn't overflow or produce unexpected results.
    
Scenario 4: Test negative values as inputs
Details:
    TestName: TestNegativeInputs
    Description: Checking the method's behavior when negative values are provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initiate the initCapacity with a negative value and loadFactor can be initialized with another negative value.
    Act: Invoke CalculateCapacity with these parameters.
    Assert: Use NUnit assertions to verify if method's output is as expected.
Validation:
    The significance of this test is demonstrating how the method behaves when negative values are provided. This provides insights into error handling and recovery in the function. 

Scenario 5: Optimization Test
Details:
    TestName: TestCalculateCapacityOptimization
    Description: This test aims to provide evidence for the solution's speed or efficiency.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initiate initCapacity and loadFactor with random values.
    Act: Repeatedly invoke CalculateCapacity method for a substantial number of times (for example, 10000 times).
    Assert: Measure the execution time, ensuring that it stays within acceptable limits.
Validation:
    This test confirms whether the CalculateCapacity method will run optimally, even when called multiple times in succession.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Memory consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The provided code could potentially allow for a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via excessive memory consumption. This could occur in the 'HashMap64' class, where the 'Resize' method creates a new 'HashMap64' instance and copies all elements from the old instance to the new one. If a large number of elements are present in the map, this operation could consume significant amounts of memory.
Solution: Consider implementing dynamic memory allocation techniques to manage memory usage efficiently. For example, instead of creating a new 'HashMap64' instance every time the map needs resizing, allocate a larger array and copy the elements of the existing array into it. Furthermore, make sure to nullify references to the old map after copying to facilitate garbage collection.

Vulnerability: Exception handling (CWE-703)
Issue: In the provided 'HashMap64' class, the 'Insert' and 'InsertOrUpdate' methods throw an 'ArgumentException' if a key already exists in the map. While this isn't a security issue per se, improper exception handling can expose sensitive information to attackers, crash the software or cause other unpredictable behaviour.
Solution: Ensure exceptions are handled in a safe manner, providing as little implementation detail as possible. Also, consider if throwing an exception is the best approach for handling duplicate keys. It might be more user-friendly to simply indicate that the key already exists, instead of terminating the program execution with an exception.

Vulnerability: Thread safety (CWE-662)
Issue: The 'HashMap64' class is not thread-safe. Multiple threads can insert, remove, or update keys and values in an unpredictable and potentially damaging manner. This lack of thread safety can lead to data corruption or unintended behavior in multithreaded applications.
Solution: Ensure critical sections of code are locked to prevent simultaneous modification by multiple threads. Take advantage of C#'s built-in threading and synchronization constructs such as 'lock', 'Monitor', 'Mutex', 'Semaphore', and 'ReaderWriterLockSlim' to synchronize access to shared resources.
