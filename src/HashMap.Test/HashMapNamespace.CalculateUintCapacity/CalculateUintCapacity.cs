   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Verify the calculation of capacity when the initial capacity is at the maximum limit and load factor is the smallest non-zero positive number

Details:
TestName: TestCalculateUintCapacityMaxInitCapacityMinLoadFactor
Description: This test checks the CalculateUintCapacity function with maximum initial capacity and minimum load factor.
Execution:
Arrange: Set initial capacity to uint. MaxValue and load factor to float.Epsilon.
Act: invoke the CalculateUintCapacity function with the arranged parameters.
Assert: Assert that the maximum capacity is returned which should be 1941741533.
Validation:
This test ensures that the method correctly handles the case of maximum initial capacity and smallest load factor, returning the maximum possible capacity.

Scenario 2: Validate the capacity calculation when the initial capacity is zero and the load factor is 1

Details:
TestName: TestCalculateUintCapacityZeroInitCapacityOneLoadFactor
Description: This test checks the CalculateUintCapacity function with zero initial capacity and 1 as load factor.
Execution:
Arrange: Set initial capacity to zero and load factor to 1.
Act: Invoke the CalculateUintCapacity function with arranged parameters.
Assert: Assert that the capacity returned is 1 and limit capacity is also 1.
Validation:
This test verifies how the method behaves when the initial capacity is zero and load factor is one. Both the capacity and limit capacity should be one in this case.

Scenario 3: Calculate capacity when the initial capacity is a prime number and the load factor is 0.5

Details:
TestName: TestCalculateUintCapacityPrimeInitCapacityHalfLoadFactor
Description: This test checks the CalculateUintCapacity function with a prime number as initial capacity and 0.5 as load factor.
Execution:
Arrange: Set initial capacity to a prime number (for example, 7) and a load factor of 0.5.
Act: Invoke the CalculateUintCapacity function with arranged parameters. 
Assert: Assert that capacity is equal to the initial prime number and limit capacity is half of capacity.
Validation:
This test ensures that when the initial capacity is a prime number (included in the primes list of the class), the function should return that prime number as the capacity, and exactly half of that prime number as the limit capacity. This is a crucial aspect as prime numbers are used in a capacity evaluation.

Scenario 4: Validate the handling of an initial capacity that is not a prime number and a load factor of 0.75

Details:
TestName: TestCalculateUintCapacityNonPrimeInitCapacityThreeQuartersLoadFactor
Description: This test checks the CalculateUintCapacity function with non-prime initial capacity and 0.75 as load factor.
Execution:
Arrange: Set initial capacity to a non-prime number (for example, 6) and a load factor of 0.75.
Act: Invoke the CalculateUintCapacity function with the arranged parameters.
Assert: Assert that returned capacity is the next closest prime number in the existing primes list and the limit capacity is 0.75 times of capacity.
Validation:
This test scenario validates the functionality of how the method adjusts the non-prime number to the next closest prime number which is part of the primes list and calculates the limit capacity correctly.

Scenario 5: Test the capacity calculation when the initial capacity is negative and load factor is 1 (Which in practical sense is an invalid scenario)

Details:
TestName: TestCalculateUintCapacityNegativeInitCapacityOneLoadFactor
Description: This test checks the CalculateUintCapacity function with negative initial capacity and load factor as 1.
Execution:
Arrange: Set initial capacity to negative integer value (e.g., -5) and load factor as 1.
Act: Invoke the CalculateUintCapacity method with arranged parameters.
Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception (like OverflowException) is thrown by NUnit.
Validation:
This test scenario checks if the method correctly handles inappropriate input like negative initial capacity. As uint doesn't support negative numbers, it should throw an exception. This helps in robust error handling.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The HashMap implementation allows for direct object references which could lead to unauthorized access if the key is exposed or known. An attacker who guesses or steals a key can get unauthorized access to the data.
Solution: Add an additional layer of validation or authorization to ensure that the user or service has the required permissions to access the object. The key itself should not be the sole determinant for access.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation
Issue: There's no apparent input validation in the Insert and InsertOrUpdate methods, which means a key with unexpected or harmful values could be inserted
Solution: Ensure to do appropriate input validation and consider enforcing restrictions on the keys like size limit, type enforcement and filtering of special characters

Vulnerability: Array size extension vulnerability
Issue: In HandleCollisions method, depending upon the collisionEndIndex, Array.Resize is used to resize the bucket array. This can possibly be exploited by inducing numerous collisions in order to consume more memory.
Solution: Proactive measures could include setting a reasonable maximum limit for the array size, monitoring and analyzing patterns of collisions, detecting abnormal collision rates and taking appropriate actions.
