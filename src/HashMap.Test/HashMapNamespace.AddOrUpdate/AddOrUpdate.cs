   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Valid AddOrUpdate Method Invocation With New Entry

Details:
  TestName: TestAddOrUpdateWithNewEntry
  Description: This test is meant to check the valid invocation of the AddOrUpdate method. The scenario tests the case when a new entry is added to the HashMap.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap and define a key-value pair.
  Act: Invoke the AddOrUpdate method with the defined key-value pair to be added to the HashMap.
  Assert: Check that the size of the HashMap has increased by 1 and the key-value pair correctly exists in the HashMap.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the AddOrUpdate method functions correctly when adding new entries. It is expected that the new entry is added to the HashMap and that the method returns true, indicating that an addition operation was completed. This is in line with the proper behavior of the HashMap data structure.


Scenario 2: Valid AddOrUpdate Method Invocation With Existing Entry

Details:
  TestName: TestAddOrUpdateWithExistingEntry
  Description: This test is meant to check the valid invocation of the AddOrUpdate method. The scenario examines the case where the method updates an existing key-value pair.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap and add a key-value pair. Then, define a new value for the existing key.
  Act: Invoke the AddOrUpdate method with the existing key and new value.
  Assert: Verify that the size of the HashMap remains the same, and the key now maps to the new value, not the original one.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the AddOrUpdate method functions correctly when updating existing entries. The method is expected to update the value of the existing key in the HashMap and return false, indicating an update operation was performed. This follows the expected behavior of a HashMap when updating existing keys.


Scenario 3: Check Edge Case of AddOrUpdate Method With Null Value

Details:
  TestName: TestAddOrUpdateWithNullValue
  Description: This test is meant to check the edge case where the value provided to the AddOrUpdate method is null.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap and define a key-value pair with the value being null.
  Act: Invoke the AddOrUpdate method with the defined key-null pair.
  Assert: Verify that the size of the HashMap has increased by 1 and the key correctly maps to a null value.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the AddOrUpdate method can accept and handle null values. In this case, the method should return true, indicating the addition was performed, and the key should now map to a null value in the HashMap.


Scenario 4: Valid AddOrUpdate Method Invocation with Long.MinValue as key

Details:
  TestName: TestAddOrUpdateWithLongMinValueAsKey
  Description: This test is meant to check the edge case where the key provided to the AddOrUpdate method is the smallest possible long value, Long.MinValue.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HashMap and define a key-value pair with the key being Long.MinValue.
  Act: Invoke the AddOrUpdate method with the defined key-value pair.
  Assert: Verify that the size of the HashMap has increased by 1 and the Long.MinValue key correctly exists in the HashMap.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the AddOrUpdate method can accept and correctly handle the edge case when the smallest possible long value is used as a key. The method should return true, indicating the key-value pair has been added successfully.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Exposure of Sensitive Information
Issue: The namespace 'System.Runtime.InteropServices' is being used. This namespace provides a wide range of types, methods, and tools that can be used to handle unmanaged code. Using them improperly could potentially lead to leaking sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that any methods or properties from this namespace are used properly. Be mindful of any data that is passed to and from unmanaged locations, and ensure that any and all sensitive information is protected.

Vulnerability: Unbounded growth (CWE-400)
Issue: The function 'HandleCollisions' contains a scenario where the size of 'buckets' can grow indefinitely which may result in high memory consumption causing the program to be slow or crash.
Solution: Implement a checking mechanism to limit the growth of 'buckets'. Consider using a more efficient data structure or algorithm if the size grows too large regularly.

Vulnerability: Improper Exception Handling (CWE-248)
Issue: The 'Insert' and 'InsertOrUpdate' methods throw an ArgumentException if the key already exists in the map. However, these exceptions are not handled anywhere in the code, which could result in the application crashing unexpectedly under certain conditions.
Solution: Ensure proper exception handling throughout the code to ensure application stability. This includes the possibility of wrapping key operations in try-catch blocks and handling exceptions appropriately when they occur.
