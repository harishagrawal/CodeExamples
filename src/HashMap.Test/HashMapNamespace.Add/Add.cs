   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Testing Adding a New Key Value Pair

Details:
  TestName: AddNewKeyValuePairToHashMap.
  Description: The test should check if the Add method inserts a new key-value pair into the HashMap without throwing any exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: A HashMap64 instance needs to be created, along with required key(long type) and value(TValue type).
  Act: The Add method must be invoked with the created key and value as its parameters.
  Assert: The Count property of the HashMap64 instance should increase by 1 and the ContainsKey method should return true for the added key.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a new key-value pair has been successfully added to the HashMap. This functionality is required for any data structure that allows for the storage of key-value pairs.

Scenario 2: Testing Adding a Duplicate Key

Details:
  TestName: AddDuplicateKeyToHashMap.
  Description: The test should check if the Add method throws an ArgumentException when trying to add a key already present in the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: An instance of HashMap64 with at least one key-value pair should be created, and the same key along with a new value should be selected.
  Act: Invoke the Add method with the existing key and new value.
  Assert: An ArgumentException should be thrown.
Validation:
  The test checks that the HashMap prevents the addition of duplicate keys. This functionality is critical for maintaining the uniqueness of keys in the HashMap which allows for faster access to values.

Scenario 3: Testing Adding Key Value Pair to a Full HashMap

Details:
  TestName: AddKeyValueToFullHashMap.
  Description: This test checks if new key-value pairs can be inserted successfully when the HashMap is at its maximum capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of HashMap64 and fill it to its maximum capacity.
  Act: Attempt to add a new key-value pair to the HashMap.
  Assert: Despite exceeding the initial capacity, the addition should succeed and the Count property should reflect the new number of elements.
Validation:
  This test checks the dynamic re-sizing functionality of the HashMap when it reaches its initial capacity. The capacity of the HashMap should automatically increase to accommodate more elements.

Scenario 4: Testing Negative Key Addition

Details:
  TestName: InsertNegativeKeyToHashMap.
  Description: The test should check if a negative key can be added to the HashMap.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a HashMap64 instance, a negative key and a value.
  Act: Invoke the Add method with the negative key and the value.
  Assert: The negative key should be added successfully with no exceptions thrown. ContainsKey method should return true for the added key.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that negative keys can be added to the hashmap. Including negative keys expands the potential range of keys that can be used in the HashMap.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The constant values for 'loadFactor' and 'collisionRatio' are hard-coded which can be a potential security risk if they need to be updated or changed in the future.
Solution: Define 'loadFactor' and 'collisionRatio' as parameters in a configuration file and read these values into the program at runtime, this provide more flexibility and security.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The 'GetBucket' method uses a predictable hashing algorithm which may allow an attacker to deduce the key values, potentially resulting in a denial of service attack by creating hash collisions.
Solution: Consider using a more secure and unpredictable hashing algorithm or mechanism like a good cryptographic hash function.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The method 'Insert' and 'InsertOrUpdate' do not check if 'buckets' are null before dereferencing, if a null pointer is accidentally passed, a NullReferenceException will be thrown which may cause the application to crash.
Solution: Always check if an object reference is null before accessing its members.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The 'Clear' method sets 'buckets' properties to default one by one instead of releasing the entire array. This could potentially lead to memory leaks.
Solution: Consider releasing the entire 'buckets' array instead of setting default values to its members. Use 'buckets = null' or 'buckets = new HashMap64Node[0]'.

Vulnerability: CWE-259: Hard-Coded Password
Issue: The file 'FileHashHelpers.cs' contains hard-coded prime numbers which are used in the hashing algorithm. If these prime numbers get compromised, it would result in a security breach.
Solution: Store sensitive information like prime numbers in a secure or encrypted manner and use cryptographic methods to access them.
