ROOST_METHOD_HASH=ProvideCapacity_dac8fbce51
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=ProvideCapacity_0106a49c34

Test Scenario 1: 
  - Description: Verify that the method does not resize the HashMap when the provided capacity is less than the limit capacity.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class with a defined capacity.
    2. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a tempIdCount less than the limit capacity.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should remain unchanged.

Test Scenario 2: 
  - Description: Verify that the method resizes the HashMap when the provided capacity is greater than the limit capacity.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class with a defined capacity.
    2. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a tempIdCount greater than the limit capacity.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should be resized to accommodate the new tempIdCount.

Test Scenario 3: 
  - Description: Verify that the method resizes the HashMap when the provided capacity equals the limit capacity.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class with a defined capacity.
    2. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a tempIdCount equal to the limit capacity.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should be resized to accommodate the new tempIdCount.

Test Scenario 4: 
  - Description: Verify that the method works correctly when the HashMap is empty.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class without defining a capacity.
    2. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a defined tempIdCount.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should be resized to accommodate the new tempIdCount.

Test Scenario 5: 
  - Description: Verify that the method works correctly when the HashMap is not empty and the provided capacity is less than the limit capacity.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class with a defined capacity.
    2. Add elements to the HashMap.
    3. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a tempIdCount less than the limit capacity.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should remain unchanged.

Test Scenario 6: 
  - Description: Verify that the method works correctly when the HashMap is not empty and the provided capacity is greater than the limit capacity.
  - Steps: 
    1. Instantiate the HashMap64 class with a defined capacity.
    2. Add elements to the HashMap.
    3. Call the ProvideCapacity method with a tempIdCount greater than the limit capacity.
  - Expected Outcome: The HashMap's capacity should be resized to accommodate the new tempIdCount.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method 'ProvideCapacity' doesn't validate the input parameter 'tempIdCount'. This could lead to unexpected behavior or Denial of Service (DoS) if 'tempIdCount' is a negative number.
Solution: Validate 'tempIdCount' to ensure it's a non-negative number. E.g., if (tempIdCount < 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(tempIdCount));

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The method 'ProvideCapacity' doesn't seem to handle exceptions that might be thrown by 'Resize'. This could lead to resource leaks.
Solution: Use try-catch block around 'Resize' call and ensure proper resource cleanup in the catch block or finally block.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code doesn't check if 'Resize' is null before calling it. This could lead to a NullReferenceException.
Solution: Check if 'Resize' is null before calling it. E.g., if (Resize != null) Resize(tempIdCount);
