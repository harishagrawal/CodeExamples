Test Scenario 1: CalculateUintCapacity with a very low initial capacity
- Given the initial capacity is 1 and the load factor is 0.75
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 1 and the returned capacity should be 1

Test Scenario 2: CalculateUintCapacity with a very high initial capacity
- Given the initial capacity is uint.MaxValue and the load factor is 0.75
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 1941741533 and the returned capacity should be 1941741533

Test Scenario 3: CalculateUintCapacity with a negative load factor
- Given the initial capacity is 100 and the load factor is -0.75
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then an ArgumentException should be thrown

Test Scenario 4: CalculateUintCapacity with a load factor greater than 1
- Given the initial capacity is 100 and the load factor is 1.5
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then an ArgumentException should be thrown

Test Scenario 5: CalculateUintCapacity with a load factor equals to 0
- Given the initial capacity is 100 and the load factor is 0
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then an ArgumentException should be thrown

Test Scenario 6: CalculateUintCapacity with a load factor equals to 1
- Given the initial capacity is 100 and the load factor is 1
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 100 and the returned capacity should be 100

Test Scenario 7: CalculateUintCapacity with varying initial capacities and load factors
- Given the initial capacity is 1000 and the load factor is 0.5
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 1000 and the returned capacity should be 1000

Test Scenario 8: CalculateUintCapacity with varying initial capacities and load factors
- Given the initial capacity is 50000 and the load factor is 0.9
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 45000 and the returned capacity should be 45000

Test Scenario 9: CalculateUintCapacity with varying initial capacities and load factors
- Given the initial capacity is 300 and the load factor is 0.3
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 90 and the returned capacity should be 90

Test Scenario 10: CalculateUintCapacity with varying initial capacities and load factors
- Given the initial capacity is 1000000 and the load factor is 0.75
- When the CalculateUintCapacity method is called
- Then the limitCapacity should be 750000 and the returned capacity should be 750000

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the input parameters 'initCapacity' and 'loadFactor'. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if they contain inappropriate values.
Solution: Implement input validation checks at the start of the function to ensure 'initCapacity' and 'loadFactor' contain valid values.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The 'primes' array is not initialized or passed as a parameter to the function. This can lead to a null pointer exception if it's not properly initialized elsewhere.
Solution: Ensure that 'primes' array is properly initialized before its usage in the function, or pass it as a parameter to the function if it's supposed to be provided externally.

Vulnerability: CWE-670: Always-Incorrect Control Flow Implementation
Issue: The while-loop control flow depends on 'primes' array values. If 'primes' array doesn't contain values in the expected order, it may lead to an infinite loop.
Solution: Ensure that the 'primes' array is correctly ordered and implement additional checks to prevent infinite loops.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The 'limitCapacity' output parameter is not set in all execution paths. This can lead to unpredictable behavior in the calling function.
Solution: Ensure that 'limitCapacity' is set before the function returns, regardless of the execution path.
