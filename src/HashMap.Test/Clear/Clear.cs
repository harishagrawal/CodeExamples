ROOST_METHOD_HASH=Clear_63d6a85ccc
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Clear_15d01529c9

Test Scenarios for Clear() method in HashMap64 class:

1. Scenario: Verify that method successfully clears a non-empty HashMap64.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized with a set of key-value pairs.
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that the instance is empty (Count property is 0), all keys and values are reset to their default state, and no exception is thrown.

2. Scenario: Verify that method successfully handles the call when HashMap64 is already empty.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized and no key-value pair is added to it.
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that the instance remains empty (Count property is 0), all keys and values remain in their default state, and no exception is thrown.

3. Scenario: Verify that method successfully clears a HashMap64 that contains multiple types of values.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized with a set of key-value pairs where values are of different types (e.g., integer, string, boolean).
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that the instance is empty (Count property is 0), all keys and values are reset to their default state, and no exception is thrown.

4. Scenario: Verify that method successfully clears a HashMap64 that contains duplicate values.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized with a set of key-value pairs where some values are duplicated.
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that the instance is empty (Count property is 0), all keys and values are reset to their default state, and no exception is thrown.

5. Scenario: Verify that method successfully clears a HashMap64 after multiple operations.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized and various operations (e.g., Add, Remove) have been performed on it.
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that the instance is empty (Count property is 0), all keys and values are reset to their default state, and no exception is thrown.

6. Scenario: Verify that method successfully resets the internal state of HashMap64.
   - Given an instance of HashMap64 is initialized with a set of key-value pairs.
   - When the Clear method is called on this instance.
   - Then verify that all internal states (e.g., collisionEndIndex, emptySlot, Count) are reset to their default state, and no exception is thrown.


================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The code does not validate the size of 'buckets' array before accessing its elements, which could potentially lead to a buffer overflow.
Solution: Ensure that the access to the 'buckets' array is within its boundary by checking that 'i' is less than 'buckets.Length'.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check if 'buckets[i]' is null before accessing its properties. This could lead to a NullReferenceException.
Solution: Before accessing properties of 'buckets[i]', check if it is not null.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The value of 'count' is not validated before it is used to control program flow. This could lead to incorrect program behavior if 'count' is negative or greater than 'buckets.Length'.
Solution: Validate 'count' to ensure it is within expected range before using it to control program flow.
